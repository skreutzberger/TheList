# The Awesome Server Side Swift List

A curated list of awesome Server Side Swift 3 projects.

Interested in conributing? Please see the [Contributing](#contributing) section below. Please note that components targeting iOS projects will not be considered unless there is a clear use case for a server side implementation. Projects must also be SPM modules that can be included as dependancies, unless otherwise stated.

Thanks goes out to [vsouza](https://github.com/vsouza) for the inspiration of his Awesome iOS list!
